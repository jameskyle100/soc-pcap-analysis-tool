# SOC PCAP Analysis Tool

A SOC-focused PCAP triage dashboard designed to help security analysts quickly analyze packet capture files without spending hours manually reviewing traffic in Wireshark.

The tool automatically analyzes `.pcap` and `.pcapng` files and produces investigation-ready insights including network behavior, suspicious activity indicators, and a formal analysis summary report.

This tool is intended for **SOC analysts, incident responders, and threat hunters** who need rapid visibility into captured network traffic.
