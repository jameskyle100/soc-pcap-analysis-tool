# SOC PCAP Analysis Tool

A lightweight SOC-focused PCAP triage dashboard designed to help analysts quickly investigate packet captures without spending hours manually reviewing them in Wireshark.

The tool automatically analyzes a `.pcap` or `.pcapng` file and generates:

• Threat findings  
• Network behavior summary  
• Host activity insights  
• DNS and TLS indicators  
• HTTP request patterns  
• Conversation flows  
• Capture health metrics  

It also generates a **formal incident-ready analysis summary report** which can be downloaded as a **PDF**.
